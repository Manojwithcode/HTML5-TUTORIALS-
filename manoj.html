<h1> First Paragraph in the text. </h1>
<p> It looks like you're not connected to the Internet. Try these things to get connected: 

•Verify that your network cable is plugged in.


•Make sure you're not in airplane mode. Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Airplane mode and make sure it's turned off. 


•Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi, and make sure Wi-Fi is turned on. If a network you expect to see appears in the list, select the network, and then select Connect. 


•Let Windows try to help you fix the problem. In the Search box, type Network troubleshooter, and then select Identify and repair network problems. (It’ll say Control panel under the setting.) 


•Connect to a cellular network on your PC if you can. Go to Settings > Network & Internet, and see if Cellular appears in the list of settings. 


•If you're at home and expect to see your Wi-Fi network but don't, restart your Wi-Fi router. This should be a last resort.
